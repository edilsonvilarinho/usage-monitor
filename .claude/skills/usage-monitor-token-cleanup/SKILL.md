description: Measure the context Claude Code loads every session in this repository (project and global CLAUDE.md, project memory, repo skills), report evidence-backed cleanup candidates with estimated token savings, and apply only the items the user approves one by one. Use when the user asks to save tokens, trim context, clean up memory, or shrink CLAUDE.md.

# Usage Monitor Token Cleanup

Measure first, propose with evidence, ask item by item, apply only what was approved, measure again. Nothing is changed before the user picks it.

## Targets

| Target | Loaded | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | every session | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Global instructions | every session | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Memory index | every session | `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| Memory files | on demand | same folder, `*.md` |
| Skill descriptions | every session | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter |
| Skill bodies | when invoked | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |

`<project-key>` is the absolute repo path with `:`, `\` and `/` replaced by `-`.

## Workflow

1. **Measure.** Run the read-only script and keep its output as the baseline:
   ```powershell
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude\skills\usage-monitor-token-cleanup\scripts\measure_context.ps1
   ```
   Tokens are `chars / 3.5` — label them as an **estimate** everywhere; this is not the tokenizer's count.

2. **Analyze.** Every finding carries the evidence that justifies it (line numbers, command output, file names). No evidence, no finding.
   - **Project `CLAUDE.md`** — it dominates the budget. For each heavy section or first-level bullet the script lists:
     - Narrative that is history, not rule: measurements, "a primeira versão", dated incidents, run ids, how a bug was found. Candidate action: **move** it to the plan in `docs/planos/` that already covers the subject (the script lists linked plans) or to a new `docs/<area>.md`, and leave in `CLAUDE.md` the rule in 1–3 lines plus the link. The *why* must survive in the destination — moving is allowed, deleting a decision is not.
     - Duplication: the same rule stated in two sections, or restating `docs/design-system/` / `server/README.md`. Candidate action: keep one owner, link from the other.
     - Rules the tests already enforce (e.g. `ArchitectureRulesTest`) can be shortened to the rule plus the test name, never removed.
   - **Memory**:
     - Broken pointers and orphan files (script output).
     - `project_*` memories citing issues: run `gh issue view N --json state,title` for each; a memory whose issues are all closed and whose pending work is done is a candidate for deletion.
     - Memories that duplicate `CLAUDE.md`, the repo, or git history (the memory rules say not to store those).
     - Memories naming a file, function or flag: `Grep` for it; if it no longer exists, the memory is stale.
   - **Global `CLAUDE.md`**: rules redundant with the project file, or conflicting with it. Report conflicts; never resolve them silently — the global file is the user's personal instruction set.
   - **Skills**: descriptions over ~300 chars (paid every session), and bodies that repeat `CLAUDE.md` instead of pointing to it.

3. **Report.** One table, sorted by estimated savings:

   | # | Target | Finding | Evidence | Est. tokens saved | Proposed action | Reversible? |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

   Reversibility: repo files are reversible through git; memory and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` live **outside** git and are not.

4. **Ask.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`, one option per finding (batch in groups of up to 4 options per question, up to 4 questions per call). Before offering to delete or rewrite anything outside git, show its full current content in the report so the user decides on what they actually read.

5. **Apply only the approved items.**
   - Repo files: `Edit`, preserving line endings (`CLAUDE.md` is CRLF in the working copy).
   - Memory: delete the file **and** its line in `MEMORY.md`; when merging, update the surviving file and remove the other pointer.
   - Anything not selected stays untouched, including items the user did not answer.

6. **Measure again** with the same script and report before/after per target.

7. **Do not commit.** Commit only when the user asks, through `usage-monitor-commit-push`. Content moved from `CLAUDE.md` to `docs/` goes in the same commit as the removal, so no decision exists in neither place.

## Guardrails

- Never edit production code, tests, or build files.
- Never shorten a rule without the user approving that specific item.
- Never "summarize" a decision in a way that loses its reason without moving the reason somewhere.
- Never delete a memory whose issues you did not check with `gh`.
- If a finding is a judgment call (e.g. whether a passage is rule or history), say so in the Evidence column.
